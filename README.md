# Exploring Hacker News Posts

Hacker News is a forum website hosted by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is an extremely popular online destination for technology enthusiasts and budding founders, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

With a base of highly-technical users, Hacker News can often become a home for eye-opening discussion on a range of topics. Users who post original content can benefit greatly if posting at a time when the most users are online, or when the most eyeballs are on the page.

We're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
- Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
